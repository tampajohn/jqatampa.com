              <p>
                I've spent the last 10 years working in a variety of businesses. Cutting my teeth on the development of trading applications was a great way to start, as I was quickly exposed to applying complex business logic to transactional systems. During my time
                at Raymond James, I was exposed to developers that would become my mentors, as well as developers that were great examples of what not to become. After realizing that growth in a large corporation would be slow, I decided to become a consultant
                in order to increase my exposure to various technologies and methodologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a consultant I spent some time working on converting legacy systems, written in an archaic language (FoxPro), into web applications. It was evident that these applications had grown out of necessity, without any real thought behind architecture. This
                is when my passion for architecture was sparked, and it's stayed with me since.
              </p>
              <p>
                After consulting for a few years in various industries ranging from marketing to business intelligence, I eventually found a small data managment company to call home. After serving my time as the resident Software Architect, I've finally settled into
                a position as the Director of Engineering, where I'm able to apply my years of experience to help my Engineering team create scalable, modular, maintainable SaaS platforms.

                Becoming the CTO of Bringhub has offered me a lot of opportunity to set the technical direction of the company.  Having been built on antiquated tech, we decided to
                expand our companies adoption of contemporary technology by converting fully to a Go based shop.  Rewriting all of our services in a composable and scalable manner
                has allowed us to not only scale with incredible efficiency, but has also cut our costs by over 50%.
                Working with my bi-coastal team of developers has shown me that distance in a team is far from an inefficiency, but a huge benefit so long as you communicate :).

                  Yes, I ended up back at PowerChord, though this time in a slightly different role. After consulting on a relatively large release, I was offered the position of Director of Engineering at PowerChord. This has been a great change, as it's enabled me to
                  focus on creating a product-centric team with our new CTO Peter Quintas (formerly of Nomi). I was able to play with all the cool technologies, and successfully migrated my team away from the .Net stack. The new stack (fondly referred
                  to as GAMA), consisted of golang, angular, mongo, and aws. This stack was proven to be a lot more fun and performant to develop in, and I thoroughly enjoyed working in it.

                  After deciding to take a break from PowerChord, and flex my muscles elsewhere, I spent a few months working with some friends on various pet projects. During this time I was introduced to some amazing technologies, equally amazing projects, and some unbelievably
                  amazing people.
                  <br/> At first I spent some time with Fenario Group, serving as their Director of Engineering on a couple of product jobs. There we leveraged Windows Azure to create a solution to enable a client with a rather large application stack to offer
                  their product as a SaaS solution. We also were responsible for creating a quick and easy time management application (then we discovered Harvest, lol).
                  <br /> I then had the opportunity to work with a great company called <a href="http://www.64labs.com">64 labs</a>. There I worked with their development team to create a mobilized version of <a href="http://skullcandy.com">Skullcandy</a>,
                  as well as <a href="http://tractorsupplycompany.com">Tractor supply company</a>. In order to do this quickly and efficiently, all while having absolutely no access to their source, we leveraged <a href="http://moovweb">Moovweb</a>'s
                  awesome platform. This was my first introduction to what would eventually become my favorite language (golang).
                  <br /> I've kept on a couple of clients, mainly C1Bank and Bringhub. I try to keep things casual, but can't help getting excited about what both companies are doing in the product development world.
