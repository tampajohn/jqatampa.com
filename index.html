				        			I've spent the last 10 years working in a variety of businesses.  Cutting my teeth on the development of trading applications was a great way to start, as I was quickly exposed to applying complex business logic to transactional systems.  During my time at Raymond James, I was exposed to developers that would become my mentors, as well as developers that were great examples of what not to become.  After realizing that growth in a large corporation would be slow, I decided to become a consultant in order to increase my exposure to various technologies and methodologies.
				        		</p>		
				        		<p>
			        				As a consultant I spent some time working on converting legacy systems, written in an archaic language (FoxPro), into web applications.  It was evident that these applications had grown out of necessity, without any real thought behind architecture.  This is when my passion for architecture was sparked, and it's stayed with me since.
				        		</p>
				        		<p>
			        				After consulting for a few years in various industries ranging from marketing to business intelligence, I eventually found a small digital brand management company to call home.  After serving my time as a member of the development staff, I've finally settled into a position as the Senior Software Architect, where I'm able to apply my years of experience to create scalable, modular, maintainable SaaS platforms.
